/**
 * Sticky REMOTE state — the server's half.
 *
 * REMOTE used to have nowhere to live: the model re-derived it every turn by
 * rescanning the conversation. It now lives in a file, and this module is one
 * of the two places that owns a transition. The other is the plugin's
 * UserPromptSubmit hook, which enters REMOTE when a prompt matches a
 * phone-injection marker; this module handles the transitions the server
 * already knows about — a `zeph_ask` that came back answered.
 *
 * **Three implementations share the file format** — plugin/hooks/gate.sh
 * (`zeph_remote_active` / `zeph_remote_touch`), cli/src/gate.ts
 * (`isRemoteActive` / `touchRemoteActive`), and this file. Nothing checks them
 * against each other at build time, so the format is pinned by literal
 * assertions in remote-state.test.ts. The bash reader sweeps any non-numeric
 * body on sight (`case "$ts" in *[!0-9]*)`), which means a JSON or ISO-8601
 * body written here would enter REMOTE and be deleted by the very next prompt
 * hook — silently, and invisibly from either repo's tests.
 *
 * There is no TTL logic here on purpose: expiry is the readers' job, and
 * duplicating the window would give it two definitions.

 * - **enter** — the user answered with anything else: another button, or free
 *   text (no id at all). Free text the server cannot judge — "thanks, that's
 *   it" is a meaning call that stays with the model — so it counts as staying.
 * - **keep** — the ask timed out onto a non-exit fallback. Rule 5 recommends
 *   `wait`/`review` there, and ask.ts returns the fallback id verbatim, so
 *   reading it as an exit would drop a user out of REMOTE over an ask they
 *   simply had not answered yet. Nor is it an entry: a timeout is not a user
 *   action, and a NORMAL session must not become remote because nobody
 *   replied. The mode is left exactly as it was.
